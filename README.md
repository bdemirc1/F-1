This is a PERN stack app to visualize actual Formula 1 data. The project uses charts to analyze the fastest lap times per driver and total pit stop times per constructor. Users can select a race to analyze its data. It is also possible to view the constructor and drivers standing as a data table after selecting a race. Users can enable a dark theme as well.
